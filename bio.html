                    <p>My name is Patrick Sandberg and I am an aspiring game designer/level designer. I am currently in the Games and Interactive Media program offered at Michigan State University and I plan on graduating fall semester 2023. I have always been passionate about video games, ever since my parents gifted my siblings and I a Playstation 2 way back in the day. I currently game on a Playstation 4, with some of my favorite titles being Rocket League, Call of Duty, and Battlefield. </p>
                    <p>Another passion I've had since the beginning of grade school is sports. I've been involved with travel soccer as well as rec baseball, not to mention hobby sports like golf, football, and hockey. Sports have always been a freeing and surreal experience- getting the chance to be outside and let my competitive nature flourish.</p>
                    <p>A big part of my life has revolved around my family. I am the youngest of my 3 siblings, who at this point have moved all across the country persuing what they are passionate about. Having a house with 6 people in it never created dull moments, with everyone always coming in and out for sports, friends, jobs, etc. </p>
                    <p>I was drawn to Michigan State University because of it's computer science program and high-caliber video game design program. At Michigan State I have made projects I am proud to have produced, while along the way learning important development techniques like SCRUM charts and Gantt charts. My amazing professors have instilled important skills that start from pre-production all the way to the final product, and I'm hoping to implement these skills and more when I jump into my career.</p>
